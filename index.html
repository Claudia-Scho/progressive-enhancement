<h2>The story</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</p> 
<p>That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, </p>
<div style class="quotation">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</div><br> 
<p>The farmer said,</p>
<div style class="quotation">"<strong>Maybe.</strong>"</div>
<p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p>
<div style class="quotation"> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</div>
<p> farmer again said, </p>
<div style class="quotation">"<strong>Maybe.</strong>"</div>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p>
<div style class="quotation">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,” </div>
<p> the farmer responded, </p>
<div style class="quotation">"<strong>Maybe.</strong>"</div>
<p> next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, </p>
<div style class= "quotation">“Isn’t that great!”</div><br>
<p>Again, he said, </p>
<div style class= "quotation">"<strong>Maybe.</strong>"</div> 
<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="good" class="bad">Good and Bad are just one perspective.<br> Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas.<br> Let's not make a big deal out of it...
