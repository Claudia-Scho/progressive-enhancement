<h2>The story</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</p> 
<p>That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, </p>
<div style class="quotation villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</div><br> 
<p>The farmer said,</p>
<div style class="quotation farmer">"<strong>Maybe.</strong>"</div>
<p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p>
<div style class="quotation villagers"> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</div>
<p> farmer again said, </p>
<div style class="quotation farmer">"<strong>Maybe.</strong>"</div>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p>
<div style class="quotation villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,” </div>
<p> the farmer responded, </p>
<div style class="quotation farmer">"<strong>Maybe.</strong>"</div>
<p> next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, </p>
<div style class= "quotation villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</div><br>
<p>Again, he said, </p>
<div style class= "quotation farmer">"<strong>Maybe.</strong>"</div> 
<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

<h2>Dialog</h2>
<p>Here is this dialog in the form of a table.</p>

<table style="width:40%">
    <tr>
      <th>EVENT</th>
      <th><span style class="good">GOOD</span> OR <span style class ="bad">BAD</span></th> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lose a horse</td>
      <td>Maybe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Win more horses</td>
      <td>Maybe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Son injury</td>
        <td>Maybe</td> 
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Avoid war</td>
        <td>Maybe</td> 
      </tr>
  </table>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style class="good">Good</span> and <span style class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective.<br> Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas.<br> Let's not make a big deal out of it...
